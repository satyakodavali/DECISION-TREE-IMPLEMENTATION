A Decision Tree is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It splits the dataset based on feature values to form a tree-like model where each internal node is a decision based on an attribute, and each leaf represents an output label. It is easy to interpret and visualize using scikit-learn’s plot_tree(). A typical project involves loading a dataset like Iris, training the model, and evaluating it using accuracy and confusion matrix.

2. Sentiment Analysis with NLP
Sentiment Analysis is the process of classifying text as positive, negative, or neutral using Natural Language Processing (NLP). The workflow includes cleaning text, removing stopwords, lemmatization, and converting text to numerical features using techniques like TF-IDF. A machine learning model such as Naive Bayes or Logistic Regression is then trained on labeled data like IMDB movie reviews. This is commonly used for analyzing product reviews, social media, or customer feedback.

3. Image Classification Model
Image classification involves predicting the class of an image based on its content. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are the most effective models for this task. A CNN extracts features using layers like convolution, pooling, and fully connected layers. With datasets like CIFAR-10 or MNIST, the model is trained to recognize patterns such as shapes or textures. Built using TensorFlow or PyTorch, the model is evaluated using accuracy, loss graphs, and prediction samples.

4. Recommendation System (Collaborative Filtering)
A Recommendation System suggests items to users based on their preferences or behavior. Collaborative Filtering uses user-item interactions to predict what a user might like based on similar users. Matrix factorization techniques like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) help in building efficient systems. Using the Surprise library and datasets like MovieLens, the system predicts unseen ratings and recommends the top N items to each user. It’s widely used in platforms like Netflix and Amazon.
